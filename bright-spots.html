                <p>
                    Our monitoring also captures<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/?status=&tags=41&date_0=&date_1="> improvements</a> in civic space conditions. The CIVICUS Monitor has documented several instances where civic space is opening up and states are making progress on improving their respect for fundamental freedoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CIVICUS Monitor has documented instances of court rulings that defended or expanded civic space. For example, in Canada<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/10/31/canada-provinces-ban-demonstrations-near-health-facilities/">,</a> the British Columbia Supreme Court<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/10/31/canada-provinces-ban-demonstrations-near-health-facilities/"> denied</a> an application by the company Teal Cedar to extend an injunction against anti-logging protesters at Fairy Creek, validating their right to expression and peaceful assembly. In Turkey, a Court in Ankara<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2020/11/09/free-speech-under-siege-government-launches-new-unit-tackle-misinformation/"> overturned</a> the ban imposed by the Middle East Technical University (METU) Presidency on the 9th METU LGBTI Pride Parade held on the campus in 2019. In Costa Rica, the Constitutional Court<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/01/14/costa-rica-arbitrary-detention-journalist-and-criminalisation-protests/"> ratified</a> that the detention of a journalist was arbitrary as it obstructed journalistic work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Bosnia and Herzegovina, activists celebrated a<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/10/08/victory-lgbti-pride-parade-organisers-concerns-over-ddos-attacks/"> remarkable</a> victory for the freedom of peaceful assembly of LGBTQI+ people as the government of the city of Sarajevo covered the costs of additional security measures during the Pride march. This is a welcome precedent as legislation stipulates that it is the responsibility of protest organisers to cover those costs, which undermines the right to protest. A similar approach was<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/?tags=32&tags=41&page=5&date_1=2021-10-31&date_0=2020-11-01&status="> taken</a> in Norway, where the Oslo Pride parade costs were included in the 2022 budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These positive changes were a result of sustained efforts by rights advocates reinforcing the need to protect and promote civic space.
