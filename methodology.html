                <h1>Methodology</h1>

                <p>The CIVICUS Monitor aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the conditions for civil society within countries and over time. It analyses civic space, <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/whatiscivicspace/"  target="_blank">defined</a>&nbsp;as the respect in policy, law and practice for the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression and the extent to which the state protects these fundamental rights.
                </p>
                <p>In an attempt to capture these dynamics on a global scale,<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/researchpartners/"  target="_blank">over 20 organisations</a>&nbsp;with research expertise from around the world joined forces on the CIVICUS Monitor with the aim to provide an evidence base for action to improve civic space.
                </p>
                <p>Civic space updates from CIVICUS Monitor research partners contain qualitative, narrative information related to the situation for civil society in a country. This qualitative information is directed by a set of<a href="https://www.civicus.org/documents/civicus-monitor-methodology-paper.pdf"  target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.civicus.org/documents/civicus-monitor-methodology-paper.pdf"  target="_blank">guiding questions</a>&nbsp;and the resulting data is gathered from a variety of primary and secondary sources. In many cases, country-specific updates come directly from national civil society themselves. In countries where there is no research partner, the CIVICUS Monitor relies on a variety of other sources produced at the national, regional and international levels to produce analysis on civic space.
                </p>
                <p>These civic space updates are then triangulated, verified and <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/newsfeed" target="_blank">tagged</a>&nbsp;by the CIVICUS team. The tagging system helps us classify the information included in the updates and allows us to analyse the most common violations and restrictions faced by civil society groups, activists and journalists when defending their rights.
                </p>
                <p>The research partners posted a total of 568 <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/" target="_blank">civic space updates</a>&nbsp;from 1 November 2020 to 31 October 2021, which form the basis for the analysis presented in this report. For the period assessed, these civic space updates cover 156 countries and territories.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to the qualitative information presented in the civic space updates, in order to draw comparisons at the global level and track trends over time, the CIVICUS Monitor produces civic space ratings for 197 countries and territories.[1] Each country&rsquo;s civic space is rated in one of five categories &ndash; open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed or closed &ndash; based on a <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/methodology/" target="_blank">methodology</a>&nbsp;that combines several sources of data on the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression.
                </p>
                <p>This year we introduced a new quantitative indicator to evaluate the degree of respect for the freedom of peaceful assembly in each country: the Peaceful Assembly <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b2/ff/b2ff973c-1108-4f2c-b8d8-59fe744a1333/whats_new.pdf" target="_blank">indicator</a> <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/" target="_blank">developed</a>&nbsp;by Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem). This indicator replaced the Political Terror Scale (PTS) indicator, which measures the level of political terror within a country. At the time the Monitor&rsquo;s methodology was developed, this was selected as the best source of data available to evaluate the freedom of peaceful assembly. Now a more precise indicator that measures the ability to assemble publicly in practice is available.
                </p>
                <p>Because the CIVICUS Monitor surveys a variety of metrics before arriving at a country rating for civic space, this change did not cause any substantial shifts in our ratings. The PTS was one of three data points making up the Key Scores, which is one of the five data streams that lead to final ratings. Because a multiplicity of sources is used to arrive at the final ratings, overreliance on any particular data source is avoided and the stability and the sustainability of the CIVICUS Monitor ratings in the face of methodological changes are enhanced.
