                <h1>Methodology</h1>

                <p>The CIVICUS Monitor aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the conditions for civil society within countries and over time. It analyses civic space, <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/whatiscivicspace/"  target="_blank">defined</a>&nbsp;as the respect in policy, law and practice for the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression and the extent to which the state protects these fundamental rights.
                </p>
                <p>In an attempt to capture these dynamics on a global scale,<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/researchpartners/"  target="_blank">over 20 organisations</a>&nbsp;with research expertise from around the world joined forces on the CIVICUS Monitor with the aim to provide an evidence base for action to improve civic space.
                </p>
                <p>Civic space updates from CIVICUS Monitor research partners contain qualitative, narrative information related to the situation for civil society in a country. This qualitative information is directed by a set of<a href="https://www.civicus.org/documents/civicus-monitor-methodology-paper.pdf"  target="_blank">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.civicus.org/documents/civicus-monitor-methodology-paper.pdf"  target="_blank">guiding questions</a>&nbsp;and the resulting data is gathered from a variety of primary and secondary sources. In many cases, country-specific updates come directly from national civil society themselves. In countries where there is no research partner, the CIVICUS Monitor relies on a variety of other sources produced at the national, regional and international levels to produce analysis on civic space.
                </p>
                <p>These civic space updates are then triangulated, verified and <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/newsfeed" target="_blank">tagged</a>&nbsp;by the CIVICUS team. The tagging system helps us classify the information included in the updates and allows us to analyse the most common violations and restrictions faced by civil society groups, activists and journalists when defending their rights.
                </p>
                <p>The research partners posted a total of 568 <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/" target="_blank">civic space updates</a>&nbsp;from 1 November 2020 to 31 October 2021, which form the basis for the analysis presented in this report. For the period assessed, these civic space updates cover 156 countries and territories.
                </p>
                <p>In addition to the qualitative information presented in the civic space updates, in order to draw comparisons at the global level and track trends over time, the CIVICUS Monitor produces civic space ratings for 197 countries and territories.[1] Each country&rsquo;s civic space is rated in one of five categories &ndash; open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed or closed &ndash; based on a <a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/methodology/" target="_blank">methodology</a>&nbsp;that combines several sources of data on the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression.
                </p>
                <p>This year we introduced a new quantitative indicator to evaluate the degree of respect for the freedom of peaceful assembly in each country: the Peaceful Assembly <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/b2/ff/b2ff973c-1108-4f2c-b8d8-59fe744a1333/whats_new.pdf" target="_blank">indicator</a> <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/" target="_blank">developed</a>&nbsp;by Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem). This indicator replaced the Political Terror Scale (PTS) indicator, which measures the level of political terror within a country. At the time the Monitor&rsquo;s methodology was developed, this was selected as the best source of data available to evaluate the freedom of peaceful assembly. Now a more precise indicator that measures the ability to assemble publicly in practice is available.
                </p>
                <p>Because the CIVICUS Monitor surveys a variety of metrics before arriving at a country rating for civic space, this change did not cause any substantial shifts in our ratings. The PTS was one of three data points making up the Key Scores, which is one of the five data streams that lead to final ratings. Because a multiplicity of sources is used to arrive at the final ratings, overreliance on any particular data source is avoided and the stability and the sustainability of the CIVICUS Monitor ratings in the face of methodological changes are enhanced.
                </p>

                                <p>At the heart of the CIVICUS Monitor’s methodology is the combination of several independent data sources, comprising both quantitative and qualitative data. These sources include updated ratings from civil society organisations and reports from national, regional, and international civil society organisations with relevant information on the four indicators of civic space (Freedom of association, freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and the state duty to protect). These external analyses are then paired with CIVICUS’ own analysis to arrive at country ratings for all assessed countries and territories, ranging from open to narrowed, obstructed, repressed or closed.</p>

                                <p>The goal of CIVICUS Monitor is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the conditions for civil society within countries and over time. Civic space is defined as the respect in policy and practice for the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression. The state has a fundamental duty to protect these rights. As the diagram illustrates, the CIVICUS Monitor conceptualises the conditions for civil society as the respect for these four indicators.</p>

                                <p>The CIVICUS Monitor combines qualitative and quantitative data inputs generated by primary and secondary research. These inputs are split into two distinct categories: 1) the base score and 2) the live adjustment score.</p>
                                <p>Recognising that indicators used to conceptualise civic space cannot be directly observed or assessed by a single measure, our methodology constructs a composite indicator to provide an overall view of conditions in each country. To do so, we created a fixed scale which establishes the range of the CIVICUS Monitor, i.e. we impose a minimum and a maximum theoretically possible value. This range encompasses a range of completely unrestricted (100) to completely restricted (1) civic spaces. Given that the state of civic space across all countries and territories vary from very restricted to more open, we can be reasonably confident that the range we set up is broad enough to encompass the variety of civic experiences around the world.</p>

Based on this input, a country rating could change at any moment.</p>
                                <p>In addition, once a year the CIVICUS team updates the indicators of the Base Score (composed of three aggregate components: key analysis, key score, and CIVICUS analysis).

The advantage of our approach is that we give greater voice to national level civil society organisations producing data on civic space violations. We contend that actors closer to the source are best able to contextualise information and that potential incentives for over-stating restrictions are offset by local organisations' interest in remaining credible.</p>

                                <p>Ratings are on a five-category scale defined as: open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed, and closed. These ratings are conceptualised as broad bands, where a variety of civic experience can exist within any given rating category. The goal of ratings is to offer comparisons between countries and over time which are robust but responsive to current events.</p>
