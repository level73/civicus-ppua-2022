                    Mozambique has been downgraded from ‘obstructed’ to ‘repressed’ in a new report by the <a href="monitor.civicus.org">CIVICUS Monitor</a>, a global research collaboration that rates and tracks fundamental freedoms in 196 countries. According to the report, <em>People Power Under Attack 2021</em>, unwarranted restrictions on freedom of expression and a deteriorating environment in which human rights defenders and civil society operate have led to the downgrade. Physical attacks, intimidation and harassment of journalists and activists have become increasingly common.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mozambique is joining a growing list of countries on the African continent that have downgraded their civic space rating to “Repressed” in the past two years, such as Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Togo, among others. A “Repressed” rating<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/Ratings/"> means</a> civic freedoms, including the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, are severely constrained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CIVICUS Monitor is particularly concerned about the deterioration of press freedom in the country, including restrictions in the draft media and broadcasting laws, physical attacks against journalists and attempts to stifle independent voices in Mozambique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, on 9th September 2021, police officers beat and detained at least six journalists in Nampula, while they were covering a protest against alleged delays in the payment of financial relief in response to COVID-19. Equipment of some of the journalists was confiscated and returned when they were released without charge an hour later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In August 2020, the headquarters of independent media outlet <em>Canal de Moçambique</em> was broken into and set on fire with petrol bombs, destroying equipment, documents and furniture. The media outlet had previously investigated and reported on corruption. Meanwhile, its editor, Matias Guente, who received an international press freedom award this year, has been subjected to judicial harassment. A criminal case was opened against Guente in 2020 for having revealed state secrets, after Canal de Moçambique reported on an alleged contract between the government and a multinational on natural gas projects in Cabo Delgado. The journalist was questioned in September 2020, and the prosecutor announced to shelve the case in March 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Cabo Delgado, where an armed insurgency has taken place since October 2017, access to information is extremely limited, with journalists and media experiencing restrictions to report from there, including through intimidation and harassment of a journalist by government forces. Community radio journalist Ibraimo Abu Mbaruco’s whereabouts are still unknown since his disappearance in April 2020 in Palma, Cabo Delgado. In his last text message, he reportedly said he was “surrounded by the military”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The draft media law and broadcasting law are further reasons for concern as it contains several restrictions, including a prohibition of rebroadcasting of news and political programmes of international outlets and the establishment of a government-controlled media regulator, while criminalisation of some press offences remain in place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>“Year on year, we see increasing press freedom violations and attempts by authorities to stifle independent and critical voices in Mozambique and control information in the country” said Simão Tila, Executive Coordinator of JOINT – Liga das ONG em Mocambique.</em> <em>“If adopted, the draft laws on media and broadcasting will have a devastating effect on press freedom”. </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CIVICUS Monitor is also concerned about acts of intimidation, harassment, threats against civil society and journalists. Adriano Nuvunga, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development, received death threats in early October 2020. In October 2019, Anastácio Matavel, civil society activist and founder and director of FONGA-Gaza NGO Forum, was shot and killed in Xai-Xai, Gaza Province, after attending a training session on election monitoring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier this year, the Mozambican Network of Human Rights Defenders (RMDDH) wrote an open letter to President Nyusi highlighting the need to intervene in campaigns of threats, vilification and hate speech against activists, civil society, journalists and independent media who denounce or report on governance, abuse of power, corruption and human rights violations, at times conducted by individuals close to power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>“The space for dissenting and critical voices, although necessary in a functioning democracy, is becoming increasingly limited” said Simão Tila. </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over twenty organisations collaborate on the CIVICUS Monitor, providing evidence and research that help us target countries where civic freedoms are at risk. The Monitor has posted more than 550 civic space updates in the last year, which are analysed in <em>People Power Under Attack 2021</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Civic freedoms in 197 countries and territories are categorised as either closed, repressed, obstructed, narrowed or open, based on a methodology that combines several sources of data on the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mozambique is now rated ‘repressed’ on the CIVICUS Monitor. 48 other countries have this rating (<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/country/list/?country_or_region=&status_category=2&submit=Search">see all</a>).
