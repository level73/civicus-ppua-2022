                    Haiti has been downgraded from ‘obstructed’ to ‘repressed’ in a new report by the CIVICUS Monitor, a global research collaboration that rates and tracks fundamental freedoms in 197 countries and territories. According to the report, <em>People Power Under Attack 2021</em>, combined political, humanitarian and security crises have led to the downgrade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A ‘repressed’ rating means civic freedoms, including the freedoms of expression, assembly and association, are significantly constrained in Haiti. It is the second-worst rating a country can receive and other repressed countries include Colombia, Myanmar, Russia and Venezuela.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CIVICUS Monitor is particularly concerned about the unsafe environment for civil society, human rights defenders and journalists. Before his assassination in July 2021, President Jovenel Moïse had been ruling by decree for over a year in the absence of an elected legislature. Amid the enduring political crisis, civil society actors were attacked and harassed with impunity.<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2020/10/31/tension-haiti-protests-attacks-against-defenders-and-journalists/"> Human rights defenders</a> and<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2019/11/28/unrest-haiti/"> journalists</a> were killed in reprisal for their work. Reporters covering demonstrations were often<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/07/22/haiti-president-moise-assassinated-launching-country-further-uncertainty/"> targeted</a> by police. In January 2021 alone, at least five journalists were<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/02/05/presidential-decrees-could-restrict-civic-space-haiti-unrest-and-insecurity-grow/"> injured</a> covering anti-government demonstrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also concerned about the violent suppression of protests. In recent years,<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2019/11/28/unrest-haiti/"> thousands</a> have taken to the streets to protest the government and the country’s increasingly arduous living conditions. They were often met with repression, including the indiscriminate use of tear gas and firearms by police dispersing demonstrations. In November 2020, for instance, one protester was<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/02/05/presidential-decrees-could-restrict-civic-space-haiti-unrest-and-insecurity-grow/"> shot in the head</a> and eight others were admitted to hospital with bullet wounds during anti-government protests. More recently, protests against fuel shortages and gang violence have faced<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/10/28/haiti-insecurity-crisis-hampers-aid-delivery-creates-shortages-and-leads-protests/"> excessive force</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spiralling insecurity, and humanitarian and political crises have compounded the present situation. At least twice in 2021, Doctors Without Borders was<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/07/22/haiti-president-moise-assassinated-launching-country-further-uncertainty/"> forced</a> to temporarily close healthcare facilities because of robberies and clashes between armed groups. Against this increasingly volatile backdrop, humanitarian groups have<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/10/28/haiti-insecurity-crisis-hampers-aid-delivery-creates-shortages-and-leads-protests/"> struggled</a> to conduct post-earthquake relief efforts safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “In recent years, the need to maintain public order and tackle insecurity were used as excuses to constrain fundamental rights in Haiti. This was reflected in practices such as the frequent violent attacks on journalists and the suppression of protests,” said Débora Leão, Americas Civic Space Researcher at CIVICUS, “Going forward, authorities must recognise the importance of guaranteeing a safe environment for the exercise of freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before President Moïse’s assassination in July 2021, he had<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/07/22/haiti-president-moise-assassinated-launching-country-further-uncertainty/"> taken steps</a> to erode Haiti’s democratic institutions and attempted to replace its constitution. His government also acted to place further restrictions on Haitians’ right to peacefully assemble. A government decree passed in November 2020, the Decree for the Reinforcement of Public Security,<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/updates/2021/02/05/presidential-decrees-could-restrict-civic-space-haiti-unrest-and-insecurity-grow/"> expanded</a> the definition of ‘terrorism’ and its associated punishments. The decree criminalised common protest tactics, such as blocking roads. Persons convicted of ‘terrorist’ acts could face up to 50 years in jail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the wake of Moïse’s killing and the postponement of presidential elections, local civil society has pushed for a transitional government to re-establish Haiti’s democratic infrastructure. They have been key voices demanding meaningful public participation and local solutions to respond to the country’s multiple crises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Civil society has a vital role, not only in supporting Haiti’s efforts to recover and provide aid to those most in need but also in rebuilding its institutions and paving the way for free and fair elections,” said Leão.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over twenty organisations collaborate on the CIVICUS Monitor, providing evidence and research that help us target countries where civic freedoms are at risk. The Monitor has posted more than 550 civic space updates in the last year, which are analysed in <em>People Power Under Attack 2021</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Civic freedoms in 197 countries and territories are categorised as either closed, repressed, obstructed, narrowed or open, based on a methodology that combines several sources of data on the freedoms of association, peaceful assembly and expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Haiti is now rated ‘repressed’ on the CIVICUS Monitor. 49 other countries have this rating. Visit<a href="https://monitor.civicus.org/country/haiti/"> Haiti’s</a> homepage on the CIVICUS Monitor to find out more and check back regularly for the latest updates.
